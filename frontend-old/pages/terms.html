        <p class="lead">These terms of service ("Terms") apply to your access and use of fairsey

        <br>
        <h3>Accepting these Terms</h3>
        <p>If you access or use the Service, it means you agree to be bound by all
          of the terms below. So, before you use the Service, please read all of
          the terms</p>
        <ol>
          <li>If you don't agree to all of the terms below, please do not use the Service.</li>
          <li>Also, if a term does not make sense to you, please let us know by e-mailing
            <a href="mailto:support@fairsey.com">support@fairsey.com</a>.</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <h3>Changes to these Terms</h3>
        <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. For instance,
          we may need to change these Terms if we come out with a new feature or
          for some other reason.</p>
        <p>Whenever we make changes to these Terms, the changes are effective immediately
          after we post such revised Terms (indicated by revising the date at the
          top of these Terms) or upon your acceptance if we provide a mechanism for
          your immediate acceptance of the revised Terms (such as a click-through
          confirmation or acceptance button). It is your responsibility to check
          fairsey for changes to these Terms.</p>
        <p>If you continue to use the Service after the revised Terms go into effect,
          then you have accepted the changes to these Terms.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
